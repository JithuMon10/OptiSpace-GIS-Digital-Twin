# 🛰️ OptiSpace: GIS-Enabled Urban Mobility Platform

**OptiSpace** is a "Digital Twin" solution designed to solve the inefficiency of open-air parking in high-density transit hubs (e.g., International Airports). Unlike standard counters, OptiSpace uses **Spatial Logic** to enforce vehicle zoning and maximize lot capacity.

### 🚀 Key Innovations
* **GIS Integration:** Utilizes **Esri World Imagery** for precision georeferencing of parking assets.
* **Strict Zoning Logic:** Enforces specific "Geofences" for heavy logistics vehicles (Trucks/Buses) vs. consumer vehicles (SUVs/Cars).
* **Spatial Efficiency Engine:** Detects and flags "Inefficient Parking" (e.g., a Bike occupying a Premium SUV slot) in real-time.
* **Sustainability Tracking:** live calculation of CO2 emissions saved through reduced idling time.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** Leaflet.js (GIS), HTML5, CSS3 (Dark Mode Command Center)
* **Maps:** Esri ArcGIS World Imagery & Reference Layers
* **Backend:** PHP (Business Logic), MySQL (Spatial Data & Logging)
* **Architecture:** Digital Twin Simulation (Input) -> Real-time GIS Dashboard (Output)
